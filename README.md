# Mars2O
**Mars2O** is a fun arcade game for Windows and Mac. You're tasked with returning back water from Mars, but there's just one problem: the asteroid belt is abnormally turbulent! Dodge asteroids and refuel your spaceship throughout your journey back to Earth. The game was written using the Processing library in Java for my Interactive Computing Midterm Project.
